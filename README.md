# Complete end to end implentation of data science project:
Data Acquisition:
Data can be acquired from internal,external sources in any organization.
Examples of  Data source: Data reposotories,data from online repositories like US Census datasets,data logs from webservers, social media data,data streamed from online sources via APIs, web scraping and transformed data in forms of database tables

Data Preparation:
Data cleaning followed by transformation

Hypothesis and Modelling
Model the data and train the data using training set

Evaluation and Interpretation
identification of performance metrics 

Deployment
Machine leanring models are first deployed in test environment and then deployed into real time environment

Operations
 The model performance is monitored and performance downgrade is clearly monitored in this phase

Optimization
This is the final phase of any data science project that involves retraining the machine learning model in production whenever there are new data sources coming in
